# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

### Perceptron
- Perceptrons are the artificial neurons which help a machine to learn.
- There are two steps involved in a perceptron
    - Weight Multiplications
    - Activation function is applied on the product of weight and input

### Neural Network

### Backpropagation
- Backpropagation was developed by 
- Basically in the complete one cycle of neural network decision, two steps are involved together
    - Foreward Propagation
    - Backward Propagation
